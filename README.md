# Library-Database-Management-System

-> Library Data has to be stored in an efficient way so that it can
be easily retrieved and there is no use of excess memory as
well as time efficient in fetching the required data. 

-> This project aims at developing an efficient and effective
Database Management System, which stores and presents
the data without any inconsistency and redundancy. 

->  There may be several branches of the same library across
cities or states or even countries. So, that data can also be
handled and managed by the Database Management System
developed here. 

-> It stores all the data about Authors, Books and their
Publishers, number of copies of a certain book available at
a certain branch as well as the total copies. 

-> If a book demanded by a Member is not available at a
particular branch, then itâ€™s availability is searched across
other branches and lent to the Member if present at any of
the branches. 

-> It also stores information related to the Publishers and of the
Members. 

-> The issue date, return date and due dates are stored in a table and fine
is calculated using function, if returned late. 

->  Salient Feature of this model is that it handles data of
multiple branches and provides best possible way to satisfy
the needs of Members.
